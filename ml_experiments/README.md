# U-Net model for Burned Area Pattern Forecasting

This is the code for the experiment in section `Machine Learning Modeling`

You can run the experiments following the details in [https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/televit](https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/televit), using files from this directory:

- [train.yaml](./train.yaml) needs to replace `configs/train.yaml`.
- [unet_scidata.yaml](./unet_scidata.yaml) needs to be added to `configs/experiment/` directory.
- [unet_scidata.sh](./unet_scidata.sh) needs to be added to `scripts/` directory.

Then you can run the experiments, running the `unet_scidata.sh` following all the details from the [televit]([https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/televit]) repo.
